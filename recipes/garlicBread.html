    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with
        parchment paper or foil. Slice bread in half lengthwise and place on a
        large baking sheet, cut sides up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken into the yogurt mixture and mix to coat the cubes
        evenly. Seal the bowl with foil or plastic wrap. Set aside and marinate
        in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours. Better if overnight
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix butter, garlic, parsley and salt together until
        well combined. Spread evenly over bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown on the edges. If
        you want to add cheese, add it the last 2 minutes of baking. If you like
        a crispier garlic bread, bake for 3-5 minutes more, watching carefully
        until it is as golden as you like.
