    <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ginger (grated, minced, or paste)</li>
    <li>14 oz crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

    <li>1 tbsp coriander leaves</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, add yogurt, ginger, minced garlic, cumin, garam
        masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Season with a pinch of salt. Stir to
        combine everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken into the yogurt mixture and mix to coat the cubes
        evenly. Seal the bowl with foil or plastic wrap. Set aside and marinate
        in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours. Better if overnight
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan or pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Divide the
        chicken into 2 to 3 batches. Once the oil is hot add a batch of chicken
        and saute for 4 to 6 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the first batch aside and continue to repeat the process until all
        batches of chicken are sauteed.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan add 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the ginger and onions
        and saute for 4 to 6 minutes. Make sure to scrape up any brown bits in
        the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic, garam masala, and cumin. Saute for another minute or
        until fragrant. Stir constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the crushed tomatoes into the pan and season with the chili powder
        and some salt. Simmer for about 15 minutes or until the sauce thickens
        up and becomes a deep brown-red color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the sauce’s consistency with a few tablespoons of water if
        needed. Add the chicken, sugar, and heavy cream to the pan. Stir
        constantly and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes until the sauce has
        reached the desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle the coriander leaves and turn the heat off.</li>
    </ol>
